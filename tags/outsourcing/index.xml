He was great at his job enjoying writing codes, building web applications, and troubleshooting issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More than five years into his first job, his career was not moving in the direction he had hoped. He left the company in search of a better prospect. After a couple of disappointments, he returned to his first company. With hope. The team he was to join was his past neighbors, and he would be a product manager â€” something he considered an upgrade over a developer position.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
