      <description>The biennial ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Championship in 2022 has started its first semi-final leg with a draw between Indonesia and Vietnam yesterday.&#xA;It was a tense match with both teams unable to score in front of about 50,000 spectators in Gelora Bung Karno Stadium. That is a huge turnout in a country severely affected by the Covid pandemic just 2 years ago.&#xA;They will meet again for the second leg on Monday at My Dinh stadium on Monday.</description>

      <description>Photo by Brett Jordan on Unsplash&#xA;Brace yourselves. Holidays are ending I am determined to become a writer. That does not mean forgoing my day job. Once back to work, I will be away from Medium for about 13 hours straights (8 AM to 9 PM). Writings only resume at night or during weekends.&#xA;I experienced some of that reality these past 2 weeks. I had cleared my annual leaves in early December to “avoid the crowd”, so I worked the last week of December while most colleagues were away.</description>

      <description>35 years of Đổi Mới (Economic Reform) helped Vietnam from a country that had to “run for rice” (see note 1) in the early 1980s to become a middle-income country, reaching the top 20 of the world’s leading economies in terms of international trade. The Reform has turned many poor rural areas into industrial districts, farmers into city dwellers, the number of poor households has decreased sharply, the middle class has increased rapidly… But the Reform process also led to the “Reorder” among provinces and regions.</description>

      <description>Many times when I visited Singapore, I noticed that under each apartment building, there were 2–3 red-painted drums in a straight line. These drums are modified with ventilation holes, have high legs, and have discharge doors… so that when households need to burn votive paper, they can do it here.&#xA;Incense burner (source: author’s father)&#xA;In a country where more than 70% of the population is Chinese with the tradition and custom of burning votive papers a lot every Lunar New Year, anniversaries, funerals, etc.</description>
