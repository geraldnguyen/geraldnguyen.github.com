      <description>INNER JOIN vs. EXISTS Often, EXISTS and INNER JOIN can be used interchangeably to query data with existence in 2 or more tables. However, it is not always the case. There is an important inherent characteristics of INNER JOIN that every developer should keep in mind: INNER JOIN result may contain DUPLICATE data record. This is important for uniqueness-sensitive handling of query result (e.g. record count), or when migrating database table with unique constraints.</description>

      <description>Below example is for Oracle DB, but adopting for other DBMS e.g. Sybase, MS SQL… should be straightforward.&#xA;select ‘both no space’ as “String comparison in Oracle” from dual where ‘a’ = ‘a’ -- union select ‘right has single trailing space’ from dual where ‘a’ = ‘a ‘ union select ‘right has multiple trailing space’ from dual where ‘a’ = ‘a ‘ union select ‘right has single leading space’ from dual where ‘a’ = ‘ a’ union select ‘right has multiple leading space’ from dual where ‘a’ = ‘ a’ -- union select ‘left has single trailing space’ from dual where ‘a ‘ = ‘a’ union select ‘left has multiple trailing space’ from dual where ‘a ‘ = ‘a’ union select ‘left has single leading space’ from dual where ‘ a’ = ‘a’ union select ‘left has multiple leading space’ from dual where ‘ a’ = ‘a’ -- union select ‘right has single leading and trailing space’ from dual where ‘a’ = ‘ a ‘ union select ‘right has multiple leading and trailing space’ from dual where ‘a’ = ‘ a ‘ union select ‘left has single leading and trailing space’ from dual where ‘ a ‘ = ‘a’ union select ‘left has multiple leading and trailing space’ from dual where ‘ a ‘ = ‘a’ —- union select ‘both has leading and trailing space but leading space are different’ from dual where ‘ a ‘ = ‘ a ‘ </description>
