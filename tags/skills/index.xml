      <description>&lt;p&gt;Business Analysts and Product Managers are common roles within a software development team. I have seen them played by different persons or by the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used to be confused between the 2 roles, thinking they meant the same thing. I even thought that people abused the word “analyst” in the “business analyst” job title, in the same way they did with “IT analyst”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I see them as separate roles, each with its own set of responsibilities and deliveries, though there can be some overlap between the two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
