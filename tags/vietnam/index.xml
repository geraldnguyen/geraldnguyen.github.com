      <description>The biennial ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Championship in 2022 has started its first semi-final leg with a draw between Indonesia and Vietnam yesterday.&#xA;It was a tense match with both teams unable to score in front of about 50,000 spectators in Gelora Bung Karno Stadium. That is a huge turnout in a country severely affected by the Covid pandemic just 2 years ago.&#xA;They will meet again for the second leg on Monday at My Dinh stadium on Monday.</description>

The Reform has turned many poor rural areas into industrial districts, farmers into city dwellers, the number of poor households has decreased sharply, the middle class has increased rapidly… But the Reform process also led to the “Reorder” among provinces and regions.</description>
