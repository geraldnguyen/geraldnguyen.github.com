      <description>The biennial ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Championship in 2022 has started its first semi-final leg with a draw between Indonesia and Vietnam yesterday.&#xA;It was a tense match with both teams unable to score in front of about 50,000 spectators in Gelora Bung Karno Stadium. That is a huge turnout in a country severely affected by the Covid pandemic just 2 years ago.&#xA;They will meet again for the second leg on Monday at My Dinh stadium on Monday.</description>
