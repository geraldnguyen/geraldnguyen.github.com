This tropical gem, with its smooth, glossy skin and milky white interior, is a culinary delight that transcends borders, captivating the taste buds of locals and visitors alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Southeast Asia, durian is often referred to as the “king of fruits,” and it has a long history of being enjoyed by locals and visitors alike. It is commonly consumed fresh, although it is also used in various dishes such as ice cream, cakes, and candy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Durian is also a significant agricultural crop in Southeast Asia, and many farmers rely on it as a source of income. The fruit is typically harvested in the late afternoon or early evening, and it is then transported to markets and sold within a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AFF Cup needs VAR</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thailand comfortably beat Vietnam 1–0 on home soil to seal a 3–2 aggregate win and retain the crown for yet another 2 years. Theerathon Bunmathan was voted the most valuable player of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What impressed me most about Theerathon was not his consistent and superb performance but what he said after the match. Theerathon reportedly said that he wanted VAR to be available in future AFF cups because all participating teams are neighbors and should improve their games together instead of committing faults or injuring each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The biennial &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.affmitsubishielectriccup.com/2022/&#34;&gt;ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Championship in 2022&lt;/a&gt; has started its first semi-final leg with a draw between Indonesia and Vietnam yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a tense match with both teams unable to score in front of about 50,000 spectators in Gelora Bung Karno Stadium. That is a huge turnout in a country severely affected by the Covid pandemic just 2 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They will meet again for the second leg on Monday at My Dinh stadium on Monday. Greeting the Indonesia team would be at least 30,000 home fans there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
