For a team from a football-crazed Indonesia, the loss was heartbreaking for many.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some took to social media calling for the sacking of coach Shin Tae-Yong. The tag #STYOut has been trending among Indonesian fans. Some were calmer. They defended him. #STYSTAY has been trending as well. As of 11 Jan 2023, #STYSTAY appears to have an upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The biennial &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.affmitsubishielectriccup.com/2022/&#34;&gt;ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Championship in 2022&lt;/a&gt; has started its first semi-final leg with a draw between Indonesia and Vietnam yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a tense match with both teams unable to score in front of about 50,000 spectators in Gelora Bung Karno Stadium. That is a huge turnout in a country severely affected by the Covid pandemic just 2 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They will meet again for the second leg on Monday at My Dinh stadium on Monday. Greeting the Indonesia team would be at least 30,000 home fans there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
