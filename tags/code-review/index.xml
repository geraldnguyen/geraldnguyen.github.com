      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;rationale&#34;&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In all software development teams that I have been part of, we always value and encourage everyone to participate in code reviews. We see it as an effective way of learning and contributing. It has an important place in my Engineering practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We learn when we review other people’s codes. That’s actually an effective way of keeping up-to-date with what is happening to the code base, what sort of problems our colleagues are trying to solve, and what techniques they employed to solve them. Whether you are young or experienced, the delightful feeling of seeing creative solutions during code reviews is the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
