      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Lily! Clean your room right now!&amp;rsquo; Mom screamed at the top of her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I slowly began dusting the shelves of my room. A small photograph in the corner caught my attention. After observing everyone in the photograph, I realized that it was my Primary Five class photo. Hatred started coming back to me as I spotted the coolest guy in the school, Jack. One of the things he had done to me came vividly back to my mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jenkins pushed the door open. He barged in and stared daggers at me with his red fuming eyes. His hands were clenched. I stood frozen in horror.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;What is this? Blood all over your homework!&amp;rsquo; Mr. Jenkins screamed at the top of his lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In curiosity, everyone began looking at me and the homework filled with &amp;lsquo;blood&amp;rsquo;. Horrified, I began trying to remember how the &amp;lsquo;blood&amp;rsquo; got on my homework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
