      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many times when I visited Singapore, I noticed that under each apartment building, there were 2–3 red-painted drums in a straight line. These drums are modified with ventilation holes, have high legs, and have discharge doors… so that when households need to burn votive paper, they can do it here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://geraldnguyen.github.io/posts/2022/12/the-story-of-the-drums-in-singapore/0_ErJZacQ1ZKMdN4Rn.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Incense burner (source: author’s father)&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Incense burner (source: author’s father)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a country where more than 70% of the population is Chinese with the tradition and custom of burning votive papers a lot every Lunar New Year, anniversaries, funerals, etc., along with propaganda, fines for violations, uniform arrangement of such burning places proved to be very effective, significantly limiting environmental pollution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
