At the top of the import list is durian.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That was unthinkable in the past!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thailand used to have all of China’s durian imports up until 2021 but dropped to 61% in 2023, according to another Vietnamese &lt;a href=&#34;https://vneconomy.vn/nguyen-nhan-trung-quoc-ngung-nhap-sau-rieng-tu-mot-so-vung-trong-viet-nam.htm&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;. Vietnam’s fresh durian export to China, starting from July 2022, was the reason for the drop. Favorable weather, large plantations, proximity, and year-round harvest of durian were major advantages that have so far powered Vietnam’s ascension on the durian power scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Southeast Asia, durian is often referred to as the “king of fruits,” and it has a long history of being enjoyed by locals and visitors alike. It is commonly consumed fresh, although it is also used in various dishes such as ice cream, cakes, and candy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Durian is also a significant agricultural crop in Southeast Asia, and many farmers rely on it as a source of income. The fruit is typically harvested in the late afternoon or early evening, and it is then transported to markets and sold within a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
