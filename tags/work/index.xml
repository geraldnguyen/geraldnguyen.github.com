      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I met a guy who had less than a $10 in his account. He kept asking me to give him some money so that he can buy his “toy”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I said no, but he kept asking. So at last I said I would give him $2 if he did something for me. By the end of this week, he should have accumulated enough to buy what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He tried repeatedly to raise the wage. But I was firm. I told him “Take it or leave it”. No more negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
