A picture is worth a thousand words. Here are how Shift Left differs from the traditional approach
How does my team shift left? We started with unit testing, by developers, for their own codes. This is the easiest shift to implement, though it still tooks time, effort and patience to get it right. I recommend https://pragprog.com/titles/utj2/pragmatic-unit-testing-in-java-8-with-junit/ if you want quickly level-up
The next step is to submit our codes to static analysis testings such as Sonar and Veracode.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Echo API</title><link>/blog/introducing-echo-api/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/introducing-echo-api/</guid><description>Introducing Echo API: https://github.com/geraldnguyen/echo
A maven library of a /echo API that echo HTTP request info back to the caller

No - The waiters are part of Frontend. They are responsible for creating the nice visual and interactive experience such as greeting customers, arranging the tables, present the dishes - like what React or Angular codes do.
They will take your orders - like how HTML forms accept your inputs, auto-complete your sentences, or apologize that certain dishes aren&amp;rsquo;t available.
And they send your orders to the kitchen.</description></item><item><title>Simple Code - Effective UI - Month Picker</title><link>/blog/simple-code-effective-ui-month-picker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/simple-code-effective-ui-month-picker/</guid><description>Say you want to obtain a specific month within a year, what&amp;rsquo;s the most effective UI to do so?

Discussion takeWhile(Predicate) (and dropWhile(...)) is a stateful intermediate method. The maintenance of state is necessary to implement such operation
takeWhile is essentially a filtering mechanism where elements are accepted so long as the predicate is still true. Once the predicate resulting in false, all subsequence elements are dropped from the stream. A stateful variable is necessary to record the change of state trigger by that event.</description></item><item><title>Java Stream Interview Tests - Distinct Characters</title><link>/blog/java-stream-interview-tests-distinct-characters/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/java-stream-interview-tests-distinct-characters/</guid><description>Requirement Given a sentence comprising of one or multiple words separated by space, return a sorted list of distinct characters excluding space
Solve this problem using Java Stream
Hint: Use String.charAt(0) to convert a single-char string to char
Discussion This problem tests candidate&amp;rsquo;s knowledge of the following Stream methods:
Stream.of(...) or Array.stream(...) to convert an array of single-char string (e.g. from str.split(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)) to Stream&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; map(str -&amp;gt; str.charAt(0)) (Note: while String.</description></item><item><title>Spring REST API Interview Questions</title><link>/blog/spring-rest-api-interview-questions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/spring-rest-api-interview-questions/</guid><description>Fill in the blank Objective: Assess candidate&amp;rsquo;s practical experience and knowledge
Instructions: Given the below controller, fill in Spring annotations according to instruction given in javadocs
Worth paying attention:
Did the candidate notice the repetion of /friends prefix and opt to use a @RequestMapping(/friends) on the controller class How did he/she annotate the optional parameter name and id in findFriends method? What annotation can be used to force a 204 (no content) response?</description></item><item><title>Enable Comment in Hugo site</title><link>/blog/enable-comment-in-hugo-site/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/enable-comment-in-hugo-site/</guid><description>Introduction You may have noticed that this website is using a powerful-yet-easy-to-use doks theme.

I first know method reference from C#, so its Java concept is familiar to me. Or that&amp;rsquo;s what I thought until I picked up Modern Java Recipes book.
Here, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore more about the 3 forms of method references in Java

We consider it an important part in our Engineering Excellence guideline as a way of learning and contributing:
When you review other people codes, you help them and the team uncovered requirement/design/coding issues before they get into main codebase and eventually production. You also assure a consistent practice and coding standard are followed across all team members.</description></item></channel></rss>
