Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines, three Southeast Asian nations boasting rich agricultural landscapes, share a common treasure in their orchards — the Star Apple, commonly known as “vú sữa” in Vietnam, “caimito” in the Philippines, and สตาร์แอปเปิ้ล in Thailand. This tropical gem, with its smooth, glossy skin and milky white interior, is a culinary delight that transcends borders, captivating the taste buds of locals and visitors alike.

## Cultivation and Regions

Star apple thrives in warm tropical climates, making it a staple in the orchards of these Southeast Asian countries. In Vietnam, the Mekong Delta region, often referred to as the “Rice Bowl” of the country, is a prime location for star apple cultivation. Provinces like Ben Tre, Tien Giang, and Vinh Long are renowned for their orchards, where the fertile soil and ample water supply from the Mekong River create ideal conditions. Similarly, in Thailand, regions like Chanthaburi, Rayong, and Surin are known for cultivating this succulent fruit. In the Philippines, provinces in Mindanao, Visayas, and some parts of Luzon are key areas for star apple production.

## Harvest and Flavor

The harvesting season for star apple spans from late spring to early autumn in these regions. The ripe star apples showcase a vibrant spectrum of colors, ranging from deep purple to greenish-yellow, depending on the variety. Once opened, the milky white latex, earning the fruit its local nickname “breast milk,” introduces consumers to the creamy, sweet flavor that combines notes of banana, pineapple, and vanilla.

_In Vietnam, star apple is known as “vú sữa” which directly translates to “breast milk”. I prefer the name “mother milk” because the best way to eat the fruit is similar to the way a mother prepares milk for her child._

Its cultivation plays a vital role in the livelihoods of local farmers, fostering sustainable agricultural practices that have been passed down through generations.

In conclusion, star apple serves as a symbol of shared heritage and agricultural abundance across Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines.
