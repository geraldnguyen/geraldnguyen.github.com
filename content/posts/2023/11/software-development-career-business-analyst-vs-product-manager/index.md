Business Analysts and Product Managers are common roles within a software development team. I have seen them played by different persons or by the same person.

I used to be confused between the 2 roles, thinking they meant the same thing. I even thought that people abused the word “analyst” in the “business analyst” job title, in the same way they did with “IT analyst”

Now I see them as separate roles, each with its own set of responsibilities and deliveries, though there can be some overlap between the two.

Here are the key differences between a business analyst and a product manager

While being separate roles, there are still some overlaps between them

**Communication:** Both roles require excellent communication skills to interact with stakeholders. However, their focus and context differ.

**Understanding Business Needs**: Both roles need a solid understanding of the business’s objectives and customer needs. However, their focus, context, and scope of this understanding vary.

**Acting on behalf of users**: both roles represent users in some way. They aim to deliver the business outcome that users need.

In some organizations, there may be separate people performing these separate roles, collaborating to gather insights or requirements for a specific product feature or enhancement. In some others, a single person performs both.

In some, the roles are clearly defined. In others, they are vague, too generic, or encompassing of the other.

Ultimately, the specific duties and assignment of these roles can vary depending on the company, its industry, and its organizational structure.
