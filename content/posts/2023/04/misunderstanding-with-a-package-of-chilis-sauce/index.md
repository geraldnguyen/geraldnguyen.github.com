title: Misunderstanding with a package of chilis sauce
---

Mr. Jenkins pushed the door open. He barged in and stared daggers at me with his red fuming eyes. His hands were clenched. I stood frozen in horror.

'What is this? Blood all over your homework!' Mr. Jenkins screamed at the top of his lungs.

In curiosity, everyone began looking at me and the homework filled with 'blood'. Horrified, I began trying to remember how the 'blood' got on my homework.

It was a Sunday afternoon. I was about to do my homework when a notification on my phone reminded me of the upcoming party later that day. I squealed in excitement and could feel my adrenaline rushing through my veins. I was on cloud nine. It was once in a lifetime when I could finally do something enjoyable.

Once I arrived at the party venue, the music reverberated through the walls. Pieces of confetti were flying around. I was over the moon.

'What a great party!' I complimented Sam, the person that hosted the party.

'Thanks! I feel jubilant that you and everyone else are enjoying the party.' Sam said with a wide smile on his face.

Then, I played some party games. Then, I began to notice someone was missing from the party. My best friend, Cindy, was missing. I began searching for her, left, right, and center, and was beginning to give up. Out of the blue, I heard a moan coming from the kitchen.

'Do you know who is in the kitchen?' one of my classmates asked.

'I have no idea,' I said. 'I have not gone inside the kitchen since morning. But I will check now.'

Upon entering the kitchen, I was shocked to see Cindy hastily doing homework. Confused, I was brainstorming. I glimpsed at the clock hanging on the kitchen wall. It was quite late. Suddenly, a thought hit my mind- I had twenty uncompleted pages of English homework still lying on my desk. My heart started beating faster. A million thoughts went through my head. I dashed out of the kitchen, raced straight home, and searched everywhere for something to eat. However, all I could find was a small piece of bread and a packet of chili sauce. Hastily, I started scribbling down the answers while wolfing down my bread and chili sauce. I accidentally spilled chili sauce on the homework unknowingly.

'Hey! So, whose blood is this!' Mr. Jenkinsâ€™s loud booming voice snapped me back to reality.

A smile slowly formed on my face as I narrated everything to Mr. Jenkins and he shakes his head a few times and left.
