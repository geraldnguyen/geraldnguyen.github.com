'Lily! Clean your room right now!' Mom screamed at the top of her lungs.

I slowly began dusting the shelves of my room. A small photograph in the corner caught my attention. After observing everyone in the photograph, I realized that it was my Primary Five class photo. Hatred started coming back to me as I spotted the coolest guy in the school, Jack. One of the things he had done to me came vividly back to my mind.

My eyes lit up in excitement as a wide smile formed on my face. Jack had just invited me to his birthday party. My friends were green with envy when they heard the news.

'Wait, why would Jack invite you after you told the teacher that he was not listening in class?' One of my friends asked.

I ignored him and dashed straight home to ask my parents if I could attend Jack’s party. They agreed. I squealed in delight and could feel my adrenaline rushing through my veins.

The long-awaited day of the party finally arrived. Words could not describe how excited I was. I ran and jumped about. I hopped into the car as my mother drove me to Jack’s party.

When I entered the party, the loud music was vibrating. I was mesmerized as everyone at the party was popular in school. I tried to talk to them but all of them ignored me. Beginning to realize no one wanted to play with me, I crashed into a sofa as tears trickled down my eyes. I cannot help but stare at everyone as they were enjoying themselves. I slowly dared to ask Jack why everyone was ignoring me.

'Jack, why are you and everyone in this party ignoring me?' I mumbled.

'Jack just tell her the truth so we can avoid more trouble.' Jack’s friend told him.

A hundred thoughts raced through my mind. What was he talking about? What was going on?

'Look, the only reason why I invited you here is to make you left out because you informed the teacher that I wasn’t paying attention,' Jack said.

I was sinking into a sea of grief. Suddenly, I heard the voice of my mum calling me. It was music to our ears! I dashed out and sat next to my mum, narrating everything.

'Do you know why I picked you up extra early?' my mum asked me.

I shake my head.

'Because we are going to your friend’s place to play!' my mum said with a smile.

My face lit up in contentment! I had a whale of a time at my friend’s place.

'Quit building castles in the air and continue cleaning!' my mum’s loud, booming voice snapped me back to reality.

I put the photograph back on the shelf and a small smile appeared on my face.
