I have been developing Web Applications since my first job after graduation in 2007. Working on both frontend and backend then and now, I suppose I know enough about the technologies required to develop a web application. Now I want to share that with the larger community.

## Who is this for?

This course is intended for beginners who know a bit basics of programming and want to build an application that runs on the web.

The focus of this course is on the functional aspects of web application development. That is, we will learn and build a web application that works, as the requirements demand so.

Though I will cover some layout and styling topics, there are better resources on how to create nice, cool, or animated UI and engaging user experience. I'll provide links to those resources when we are on those topics.

I hope to help you achieve the following outcomes:

• Apply the knowledge and skills you have learned to build new web applications or enhance existing ones  
• Identify gaps in your knowledge and skills and self-direct your own learning

## Spoiler Alerts

If you are looking for specific technologies or programming languages, here is a quick peek for you:

1. **React JS vs. Angular vs. Vue**: I picked React JS for the frontend development, mostly for my familiarity with it. I do know Angular and a bit of Vue and may support them in the future.

2. **Node JS vs. Java vs .NET**: I picked Node JS for the backend development in order to use only one programming language, Javascript, throughout the course. I know Java very well and a bit of .NET, and may support them in the future.

3. **MongoDB vs Redis vs PostgreSQL**: I picked MongoDB for the ease of finding free hosting. It integrates well with Node JS too. I may support PostgreSQL (or any SQL-based DBMS) with Java backend in the future.
