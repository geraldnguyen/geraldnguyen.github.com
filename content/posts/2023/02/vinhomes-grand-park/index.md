A morning walk in Vinhomes Grand Park feels like a paradise. The park of light will make you forget all your worries if you take a walk there. After three years of not traveling, I was over the moon when I finally got a chance to go there.

It is located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. During the day, students can go to school, still in the Vinhomes Grand Park area. A bus called Vinbus will take you and the locals around the area to buy stuff, visit relatives or friends, or just see wonders. Vinhomes is very safe as to enter houses or swimming pools, you will have to use fingerprint unlock. It is tremendously convenient as there are shops everywhere!

At night, the park lights up and the beauty of the lights is jaw-dropping. If you are injured, there are doctors and pharmacies everywhere! Kids island is a place that will entertain little children and let them play to their heart’s content. Mouth-watering, fit for royalty, and appealing food can be found everywhere in Vinhomes Grand Park.

Vinhomes is divided into two areas — Rainbow and Origami. Origami may be a little more expensive than Rainbow, but the sacrifice is well worth it. Imagine paying a little more money but seeing gorgeous, stunning views of Origami every day. Rainbow is also pretty. Origami is prettier than rainbow as Origami is newer than Rainbow and is built using the Japanese style.

In both Origami and Rainbow, playgrounds and exercise areas are found in every nook and cranny. If you take a walk in the park at night, you will have enjoyment. Breathing the fresh air, smelling the grass… It will make you feel like you are dreaming.
