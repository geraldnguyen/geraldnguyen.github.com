# The Incumbents

## [Toward Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)

{{< quote "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes." />}} 

**Followers**: 652K (as of 17 Jan 2023)

**Review**: The most popular tech-oriented publication on Medium with huge followers on Medium, Twitter, and LinkedIn. If you write about data science or its related topics, this is one to apply for. Be prepared to submit your best writing as the [submission guideline](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-get-published-on-gitconnected-dac547ef556b) is comprehensive.

## [Better Programming](https://betterprogramming.pub/)

{{< quote "Advice for programmers." />}}

**Followers**: 211K (as of 17 Jan 2023)

**Review**: Covering a good variety of topics related to programming and software development. The publication’s design is simple and its [submission requirement](https://betterprogramming.pub/write-for-us-5c4bcba59397) is straightforward. It counts Medium’s CEO among its editor team. Great platform for non-data science developers/writers.

## [Level-up Coding](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/)

{{< quote "Coding tutorials and news. The developer homepage gitconnected.com && skilled.dev && levelup.dev" />}}

**Followers**: 84K (as of 17 Jan 2023)

**Review**: A very popular and well-curated publication focusing on programming in different languages and frameworks. The editors are responsive yet selective in their selection. Be sure to do your homework before [applying](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-get-published-on-gitconnected-dac547ef556b).

## [JavaScript in Plain English](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/)

{{< quote "If it compiles down to JS, chances are that we’re writing about it!" />}}

**Followers**: 68K (as of 17 Jan 2023)

**Review**: A popular publication for JavaScript developers with articles covering mostly UI developments. The editors are responsive. Given its large follower base, if your interests align with this publication, you should [apply](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/https-medium-com-javascript-in-plain-english-join-our-team-b0854ead7d14) to be a writer

## [**Bits & Pieces**](https://blog.bitsrc.io/)

{{< quote "The blog for advanced web and frontend development articles, tutorials, and news. Love JavaScript? Follow to get the best stories." />}}

**Followers**: 37K (as of 17 Jan 2023)

**Review**: The 2nd most popular JavaScript-focused publication with a little bias for React by letting it have its own navigation menu. While I don’t like the long aggressive self-promotion of [https://bit.cloud/](https://bit.cloud/) at the end of every post, it is not the worst. If you are interested, apply to join [here](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-write-a-post-for-bits-and-pieces-13de0133151b).

## [Towards AI](https://pub.towardsai.net/)

**Followers**: 29K (as of 17 Jan 2023)

**Review**: A publication dedicated to AI and machine learning topics. With AI gaining more popularity and importance, I think this is a great platform for AI writers to grow their audiences. Applying to become a writer [here](https://pub.towardsai.net/submit-your-medium-story-to-towards-ai-a4fa7e8b141d).

**Followers**: 26K (as of 17 Jan 2023)

If they are your target audience, you should [apply to write](https://medium.com/geekculture/geek-culture-submissions-2215ec0e425e) for this publication.

# Honorable mentions

## [Python in Plain English](https://python.plainenglish.io/) and [AWS in Plain English](https://aws.plainenglish.io/)

From the same editorial team that manages the 68K-follower JavaScript in Plain English (see above), these 2 publications have a combined follower count reaching 20K.

## [Dev Genius](https://blog.devgenius.io/)

Another programming publication with more than 15K followers. It has a good variety of topics and simple [submission requirements](https://blog.devgenius.io/write-for-us-6b370f49a493)

## [CodeX](https://medium.com/codex)

It was founded by a 15-year-old in June 2020 and has grown to a 15k-follower publication today. It is similar to the Geek Culture, covering a variety of topics related to technology and programming. However, since the founder’s [departure](https://medium.com/codex/im-leaving-codex-19caf6015b91), I feel the publication rate has slowed down.

## [Technology Hits](https://medium.com/technology-hits)

Despite being a new publication in the tech space, Technology Hits is a publication to watch for. Backed by the mighty [Illumination](https://medium.com/illumination), this publication has the potential to grow fast. Easily compared to [Geek Culture](https://medium.com/geekculture) in [its general-ish coverage](https://medium.com/readers-digests/inviting-storytellers-from-all-aspects-of-technology-9bf7ce2b43c8), Technology Hits distinguishes itself with better content curation and navigation. Being less geeky also appeals to the general readers.

# Downvoted

## [Javarevisited](https://medium.com/javarevisited)

Mostly Java, but also includes other topics. Interview questions, affiliated contents, and referrals to online courses are aggressive and prevalent. Even though responsive to new submissions, the editors often insert their own affiliate links in your content without discussing them with the submitters. I have withdrawn all my articles from this publication.
