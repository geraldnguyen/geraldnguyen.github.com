Maven is the most popular build and dependency management system from the Apache Foundation.

If you plan to develop serious applications in Java or if you have just started to, you have better pick up Maven. I have just the resources for you below to learn about it and move from Beginner to Intermediate in no time.

# Beginner tutorial

I often recommend Baeldung.com to my friends for beginner-level tutorials. They did it again here with this simple and easy-to-follow [Maven tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/maven)

_(There are some issues with Medium’s embedding the above link — please bear with it for now)_

Another tutorial I find helpful is from the Spring framework. If you plan to pick up Springboot development later, give it a look.

# Intermediate Concepts and Techniques

When troubleshooting a dependency issue at work, this excellent guide from Java Champion Chandra Guntur quickly equipped me with what I needed to understand the issue and devise a solution. It is practical, visual, and concise.

As an Intermediate, you will often need to figure out things by yourself. Nothing beat a good reference there. I recommend you go to the authoritative source of Maven itself.

Here are a few shortcuts:
