The biennial [ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Championship in 2022](https://www.affmitsubishielectriccup.com/2022/) has started its first semi-final leg with a draw between Indonesia and Vietnam yesterday.

It was a tense match with both teams unable to score in front of about 50,000 spectators in Gelora Bung Karno Stadium. That is a huge turnout in a country severely affected by the Covid pandemic just 2 years ago.

They will meet again for the second leg on Monday at My Dinh stadium on Monday. Greeting the Indonesia team would be at least 30,000 home fans there.

Later today, the Malaysia national team will greet Thailand in front of 59,000 fans. This is a huge number despite being 21,000 short because part of the Bukit Jalil National Stadium is closed for the setup of Jay Chou’s concert on 15 Jan 2023. So far, the Malaysia team has made the best out of the home support. They beat Myanmar 1–0 in the opening match and comfortably thrashed Singapore to qualify for the semifinal.

The powerhouse Thailand has not needed much home support so far comfortably beating the Philippines and Cambodia in both matches on home soil. But do watch out for the Thai fan. They are just as passionate as their rivals from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
