The title is loosely translated from a Vietnamese idiom

> Nước đổ lá môn

A popular variation of this idiom replaces “_lá môn_” with “_lá khoai_” even though there are different types of leaves with the “_khoai_” prefix such as “_lá khoai lang_” (potato leaves, “_lá_” means “_leaf_” in Vietnamese), “_lá khoai mì_” (Cassava leaves)…

> Nước đổ lá khoai

Another variation replaces the taro leaf with a duck’s head

> Nước đổ đầu vịt

# Usage

This idiom has the same meaning as the English saying “_like water off a duck’s back_”.

It is often used to express criticism or warning that some advice or action has no effect
