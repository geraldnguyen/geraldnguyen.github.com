I found these 2 articles discussing "who owns the source code" issue.

The first article discusses the issues using US copyright law; the second is in the context of New Zealand. There are slight difference between the 2 laws with regard to Contractor/Customer relationship but the case of Employee/Employer is the same: without explicit agreement (contract), the Employer owns the source code.

In Singapore, it is the same: Employer is the copyright holder. This article briefly mentions it: http://www.guidemesingapore.com/incorporation/trademarks/singapore-copyright-law-introduction
