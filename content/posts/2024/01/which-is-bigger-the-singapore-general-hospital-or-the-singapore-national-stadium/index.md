title: Which is bigger, the Singapore General Hospital or the Singapore National Stadium?
---

For some reason, my son, 6-yo, likes to compare the sizes of areas and buildings. This time, he wanted to know which was bigger, the Singapore General Hospital (aka SGH) and the Singapore National Stadium.

# The Singapore General Hospital

The Singapore General Hospital, also known as SGH, is among the best-known names in Singapore and also ranks among the world's best hospitals. It is the largest hospital in Singapore with more than 50 clinical specialties, medical training, and research on its campus.

When we compare the size of SGH, we need to take into consideration all its buildings including all public and privately accessible, conducting treatment, teaching, and clinal research… on its campus.

According to [SGH’s Campus Masterplan](https://www.sgh.com.sg/about-us/corporate-profile/Pages/SGH-Campus-Masterplan.aspx), SGH is divided into 3 integrated zones for Education, Research, and Patient Care over **_43 hectares_** of total land area.

# The Singapore National Stadium

The Singapore National Stadium is part of the Singapore Sports Hub which itself comprises other facilities in the same location. Given that my son was not exposed much to other facilities and that Singapore residents often refer to the area simply as National Stadium, we will research the area of the Singapore Sports Hub instead of just the stadium.

Conveniently located near central business districts and other famous sights, the Singapore Sports Hub offers an integrated sports, entertainment, and lifestyle experience. Among its main facilities are the 55,000-seat National Stadium, a 6,000-capacity indoor aquatics center, the 12,000-capacity Singapore Indoor Stadium, a sports museum, an outdoor water center and playground, a shopping mall, a national library, and various community facilities.

According to [its factsheet](https://www.sportshub.com.sg/sites/default/files/2023-12/Singapore_Sports_Hub_Fact_Sheet_Updated_19Dec2023.pdf), the Singapore Sports Hub spans a total of **35 hectares**.
