The Singapore Nationwide AWS LLM League 2024 concluded today with the grand finale at Raffle City Convention Center. The 5 finalists competed on stage for the top prizes including Amazon vouchers, Amazon Echo, and exclusive swags.

Each finalist, using their own finetuned Llama-3–8B model, answers a series of questions on Singapore culture. Their answers were then shared with a panel of 1 AI judge and a panel of 5 human judges for scoring. They were also shared with hundreds of live and virtual audiences for voting. Fan votes accounted for 20% of each answer’s final score while each AI and human panel contributed 40%.

After 7 rounds and lots of excitement, Andy emerged as the Champion of this year's competition, Chee Hoe was Runner-up, while Sheila, Swee Heng, and Sarah took the 3rd, 4th, and 5th positions respectively.

More than 1000 persons participated in the league. They came from diverse backgrounds but all share an interest and curiosity about AI and large language models.

Organized by [Gen-C](https://gen-c.info/) with sponsors and support from AWS, AI Singapore, and NLB, the league started with the first workshop on 8th September at library@harbourfront. There were a total of 4 [workshops](https://gen-c.info/workshops.html) and 3 clinics organized, lots of [discord](https://discord.com/channels/1269116420776792177/1269116421217062982)\-ing and volunteer support by Gen-C members and participants themselves, and probably thousands of hours of LLM fine-tuning on AWS Sagemaker. All were free.

It’s amazing how the organizing team has simplified, explained, trained and supported participants, many without much coding or technical background, to fine-tune an LLama-3–8B model to compete against the more advanced Llama-3–70B model. Through various activities, we learned to use AWS S3, Sagemaker and [PartyRock](https://partyrock.aws/u/TheRayG/PmL1RViBp/AWS-LOL-Datasets-Generator) to train the LLama-3–8B model by synthesizing training dataset and hyperparameters. If we were noobs before, epoch, learning rate, Lora, batch, JSONL, and prompt engineering… are now part of our vocabulary.

Generative AI and AI in general will change the way we work and live. The question each of us must ask is how we can prepare ourselves for the new reality. Some jobs may disappear but new ones will certainly emerge. Let’s welcome the change prepared and frontrunning.

Thanks the team!
