title: A lesson on working hard and working smart
---

Yesterday I met a guy who had less than a $10 in his account. He kept asking me to give him some money so that he can buy his “toy”.

I said no, but he kept asking. So at last I said I would give him $2 if he did something for me. By the end of this week, he should have accumulated enough to buy what he wanted.

He tried repeatedly to raise the wage. But I was firm. I told him “Take it or leave it”. No more negotiation.

Finally he gave up “Never mind. I’ll just ask mom” 🤣

Sometimes, working hard is not enough. You have to work smart too. And sometimes, you just have to know when to negotiate, and when to walk away.
