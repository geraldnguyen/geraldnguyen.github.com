title: How networking helps you land a perfect job
---

If you are looking for work, take advantage of networking and personal relationship. The longer the relationship lasts, the more advantageous it becomes.

There was a young guy I have known for 7 year and yesterday I offered him a job immediately after he asked.

The work was simple. Compensation was generous, 1 day pay for at most half hour work. Location superb, WFH guaranteed.
