**Caller**: I just have to praise my husband. He’s such a sentimental person.

**Radio host**: Oh? What makes you say that?

**Caller**: Well, he remained calm when I dropped my diamond ring 2 years ago, and he was cool when our new mansion suffered a terrible flooding. But yesterday, I threw away an old bag with just a few old USB keys, and he’s been crying nonstop!

**Radio host**: (laughs) That’s quite a contrast! What’s so special about that old bag?

**Caller**: It’s just an old bag… but I guess it’s been around since January 2009.

**Radio host**: (pauses) Well, thank you for sharing that story with us!

**Radio host**: And thank you, Mrs…?

**Caller**: Nakamoto.

**Radio host**: (pauses, surprised) Nakamoto?! (laughs) Well, I think we know why that old bag was so precious!
