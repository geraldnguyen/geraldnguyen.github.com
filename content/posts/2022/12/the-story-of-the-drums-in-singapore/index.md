Many times when I visited Singapore, I noticed that under each apartment building, there were 2–3 red-painted drums in a straight line. These drums are modified with ventilation holes, have high legs, and have discharge doors… so that when households need to burn votive paper, they can do it here.

In a country where more than 70% of the population is Chinese with the tradition and custom of burning votive papers a lot every Lunar New Year, anniversaries, funerals, etc., along with propaganda, fines for violations, uniform arrangement of such burning places proved to be very effective, significantly limiting environmental pollution.

Or regarding environmental pollution management of noise and dust during construction and repair of commercial and residential apartments, in addition to requiring permission, the Singapore government stipulates very clearly that such work cannot be done after 5 pm daily and during the weekend to ensure the people’s right to rest.

Similarly, not only general propaganda about waste classification, and making use of recyclable and reusable waste, but the Singapore government also has a very practical policy of distributing a free-of-charge type of packaging specifically for households to store these types of waste separately. These characteristic yellow plastic bags are organized by the Town Councils (equivalent to districts in Vietnam) to be delivered to each household monthly.

Besides, in order to ensure a clean environment, all public places in the apartment complex from corridors of floors to walkways, parking lots, and exercise spaces… are cleaned every day. Therefore, this small country now has more than 2,000 companies specializing in providing cleaning and sanitation services with about 70,000 employees.

Funds for ensuring environmental sanitation are not only spent from the budget but also contributed by residents. But the “secret” here is that the government makes it their responsibility, thus avoiding the situation of “common father, no one cries”.
