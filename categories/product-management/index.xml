He was great at his job enjoying writing codes, building web applications, and troubleshooting issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More than five years into his first job, his career was not moving in the direction he had hoped. He left the company in search of a better prospect. After a couple of disappointments, he returned to his first company. With hope. The team he was to join was his past neighbors, and he would be a product manager — something he considered an upgrade over a developer position.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She was great at her job.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She designed new features, wrote specifications, updated user guides, conducted user training workshops, collaborated with developers, users, and other stakeholders… Her daily responsibilities predominantly fit those often found in a product manager’s job description&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But she didn’t become a product manager. The company tried to put her into that role, but she disliked it. It requires too many other things for her to enjoy the work. Not everyone likes Marketing, P&amp;amp;L, and Sales…. Not her especially. Plus she hated the politics on the Product teams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
