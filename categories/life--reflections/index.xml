      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I met a guy who had less than a $10 in his account. He kept asking me to give him some money so that he can buy his “toy”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I said no, but he kept asking. So at last I said I would give him $2 if he did something for me. By the end of this week, he should have accumulated enough to buy what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He tried repeatedly to raise the wage. But I was firm. I told him “Take it or leave it”. No more negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caller&lt;/strong&gt;: My husband is such a sentimental person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radio host&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh? What makes you say that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caller&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, he remained calm when I dropped my diamond ring 2 years ago, and he was cool when our new mansion suffered a terrible flooding. But yesterday, I threw away an old bag with just a few old USB keys, and he’s been crying nonstop!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radio host&lt;/strong&gt;: (laughs) That’s quite a contrast! What’s so special about that old bag?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Feeling Left Out</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Lily! Clean your room right now!&amp;rsquo; Mom screamed at the top of her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I slowly began dusting the shelves of my room. A small photograph in the corner caught my attention. After observing everyone in the photograph, I realized that it was my Primary Five class photo. Hatred started coming back to me as I spotted the coolest guy in the school, Jack. One of the things he had done to me came vividly back to my mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jenkins pushed the door open. He barged in and stared daggers at me with his red fuming eyes. His hands were clenched. I stood frozen in horror.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;What is this? Blood all over your homework!&amp;rsquo; Mr. Jenkins screamed at the top of his lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In curiosity, everyone began looking at me and the homework filled with &amp;lsquo;blood&amp;rsquo;. Horrified, I began trying to remember how the &amp;lsquo;blood&amp;rsquo; got on my homework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vinhomes Grand Park</title>

      <description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*mw3b_HAPUgQGEG-QM2gwpw.png&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;By the real author’s father&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;By the real author’s father&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A morning walk in Vinhomes Grand Park feels like a paradise. The park of light will make you forget all your worries if you take a walk there. After three years of not traveling, I was over the moon when I finally got a chance to go there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. During the day, students can go to school, still in the Vinhomes Grand Park area. A bus called Vinbus will take you and the locals around the area to buy stuff, visit relatives or friends, or just see wonders. Vinhomes is very safe as to enter houses or swimming pools, you will have to use fingerprint unlock. It is tremendously convenient as there are shops everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
