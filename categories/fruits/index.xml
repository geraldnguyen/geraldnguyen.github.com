      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Southeast Asia, durian is often referred to as the “king of fruits,” and it has a long history of being enjoyed by locals and visitors alike. It is commonly consumed fresh, although it is also used in various dishes such as ice cream, cakes, and candy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Durian is also a significant agricultural crop in Southeast Asia, and many farmers rely on it as a source of income. The fruit is typically harvested in the late afternoon or early evening, and it is then transported to markets and sold within a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
