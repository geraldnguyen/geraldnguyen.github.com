      <description>35 years of Đổi Mới (Economic Reform) helped Vietnam from a country that had to “run for rice” (see note 1) in the early 1980s to become a middle-income country, reaching the top 20 of the world’s leading economies in terms of international trade. The Reform has turned many poor rural areas into industrial districts, farmers into city dwellers, the number of poor households has decreased sharply, the middle class has increased rapidly… But the Reform process also led to the “Reorder” among provinces and regions.</description>

      <description>Many times when I visited Singapore, I noticed that under each apartment building, there were 2–3 red-painted drums in a straight line. These drums are modified with ventilation holes, have high legs, and have discharge doors… so that when households need to burn votive paper, they can do it here.&#xA;Incense burner (source: author’s father)&#xA;In a country where more than 70% of the population is Chinese with the tradition and custom of burning votive papers a lot every Lunar New Year, anniversaries, funerals, etc.</description>

      <description>Photo by Glenn Carstens-Peters on Unsplash&#xA;I’m a programmer by trade and write codes for a living. Then 1 month ago, I decided to become a writer. Here are the reasons why I did it and how I do it.&#xA;I’m pursuing my hobby I never considered writing a hobby. I barely managed to pass my literature and English classes. I preferred subjects that did not require writing such as Mathematics, Chemistry, or Physics.</description>

      <description>(Disclaimer: I’m no economist. I simply find this story/concept interesting and want to share it)&#xA;If you initially have $2000 cash and you buy yourself a new smartphone (or any other good). Let’s say it costs you $1000.&#xA;So, after your buying:&#xA;– You have $1000 left&#xA;– Seller have $1000 revenue&#xA;– You have a good (i.e. the phone) worth $1000.&#xA;Thus your initial $2000 is split into 3 pieces which in total worth $3000.</description>
