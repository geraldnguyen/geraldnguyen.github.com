      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I met a guy who had less than a $10 in his account. He kept asking me to give him some money so that he can buy his “toy”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I said no, but he kept asking. So at last I said I would give him $2 if he did something for me. By the end of this week, he should have accumulated enough to buy what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He tried repeatedly to raise the wage. But I was firm. I told him “Take it or leave it”. No more negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caller&lt;/strong&gt;: My husband is such a sentimental person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radio host&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh? What makes you say that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caller&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, he remained calm when I dropped my diamond ring 2 years ago, and he was cool when our new mansion suffered a terrible flooding. But yesterday, I threw away an old bag with just a few old USB keys, and he’s been crying nonstop!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radio host&lt;/strong&gt;: (laughs) That’s quite a contrast! What’s so special about that old bag?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
