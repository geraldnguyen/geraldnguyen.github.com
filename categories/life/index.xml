      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I met a guy who had less than a $10 in his account. He kept asking me to give him some money so that he can buy his “toy”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I said no, but he kept asking. So at last I said I would give him $2 if he did something for me. By the end of this week, he should have accumulated enough to buy what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He tried repeatedly to raise the wage. But I was firm. I told him “Take it or leave it”. No more negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caller&lt;/strong&gt;: My husband is such a sentimental person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radio host&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh? What makes you say that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caller&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, he remained calm when I dropped my diamond ring 2 years ago, and he was cool when our new mansion suffered a terrible flooding. But yesterday, I threw away an old bag with just a few old USB keys, and he’s been crying nonstop!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radio host&lt;/strong&gt;: (laughs) That’s quite a contrast! What’s so special about that old bag?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Lily! Clean your room right now!&amp;rsquo; Mom screamed at the top of her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I slowly began dusting the shelves of my room. A small photograph in the corner caught my attention. After observing everyone in the photograph, I realized that it was my Primary Five class photo. Hatred started coming back to me as I spotted the coolest guy in the school, Jack. One of the things he had done to me came vividly back to my mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jenkins pushed the door open. He barged in and stared daggers at me with his red fuming eyes. His hands were clenched. I stood frozen in horror.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;What is this? Blood all over your homework!&amp;rsquo; Mr. Jenkins screamed at the top of his lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In curiosity, everyone began looking at me and the homework filled with &amp;lsquo;blood&amp;rsquo;. Horrified, I began trying to remember how the &amp;lsquo;blood&amp;rsquo; got on my homework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
