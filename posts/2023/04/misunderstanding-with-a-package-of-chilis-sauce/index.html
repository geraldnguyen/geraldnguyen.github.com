  <p>Mr. Jenkins pushed the door open. He barged in and stared daggers at me with his red fuming eyes. His hands were clenched. I stood frozen in horror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is this? Blood all over your homework!&rsquo; Mr. Jenkins screamed at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>In curiosity, everyone began looking at me and the homework filled with &lsquo;blood&rsquo;. Horrified, I began trying to remember how the &lsquo;blood&rsquo; got on my homework.</p>
<p>It was a Sunday afternoon. I was about to do my homework when a notification on my phone reminded me of the upcoming party later that day. I squealed in excitement and could feel my adrenaline rushing through my veins. I was on cloud nine. It was once in a lifetime when I could finally do something enjoyable.</p>
<p>Once I arrived at the party venue, the music reverberated through the walls. Pieces of confetti were flying around. I was over the moon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a great party!&rsquo; I complimented Sam, the person that hosted the party.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks! I feel jubilant that you and everyone else are enjoying the party.&rsquo; Sam said with a wide smile on his face.</p>
<p>Then, I played some party games. Then, I began to notice someone was missing from the party. My best friend, Cindy, was missing. I began searching for her, left, right, and center, and was beginning to give up. Out of the blue, I heard a moan coming from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know who is in the kitchen?&rsquo; one of my classmates asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no idea,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I have not gone inside the kitchen since morning. But I will check now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Upon entering the kitchen, I was shocked to see Cindy hastily doing homework. Confused, I was brainstorming. I glimpsed at the clock hanging on the kitchen wall. It was quite late. Suddenly, a thought hit my mind- I had twenty uncompleted pages of English homework still lying on my desk. My heart started beating faster. A million thoughts went through my head. I dashed out of the kitchen, raced straight home, and searched everywhere for something to eat. However, all I could find was a small piece of bread and a packet of chili sauce. Hastily, I started scribbling down the answers while wolfing down my bread and chili sauce. I accidentally spilled chili sauce on the homework unknowingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey! So, whose blood is this!&rsquo; Mr. Jenkins’s loud booming voice snapped me back to reality.</p>
<p>A smile slowly formed on my face as I narrated everything to Mr. Jenkins and he shakes his head a few times and left.</p>

<p>A school story with a spicy twist!</p>
