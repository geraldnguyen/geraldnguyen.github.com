  <p>&lsquo;Lily! Clean your room right now!&rsquo; Mom screamed at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p>I slowly began dusting the shelves of my room. A small photograph in the corner caught my attention. After observing everyone in the photograph, I realized that it was my Primary Five class photo. Hatred started coming back to me as I spotted the coolest guy in the school, Jack. One of the things he had done to me came vividly back to my mind.</p>
<p>My eyes lit up in excitement as a wide smile formed on my face. Jack had just invited me to his birthday party. My friends were green with envy when they heard the news.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait, why would Jack invite you after you told the teacher that he was not listening in class?&rsquo; One of my friends asked.</p>
<p>I ignored him and dashed straight home to ask my parents if I could attend Jack’s party. They agreed. I squealed in delight and could feel my adrenaline rushing through my veins.</p>
<p>The long-awaited day of the party finally arrived. Words could not describe how excited I was. I ran and jumped about. I hopped into the car as my mother drove me to Jack’s party.</p>
<p>When I entered the party, the loud music was vibrating. I was mesmerized as everyone at the party was popular in school. I tried to talk to them but all of them ignored me. Beginning to realize no one wanted to play with me, I crashed into a sofa as tears trickled down my eyes. I cannot help but stare at everyone as they were enjoying themselves. I slowly dared to ask Jack why everyone was ignoring me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jack, why are you and everyone in this party ignoring me?&rsquo; I mumbled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jack just tell her the truth so we can avoid more trouble.&rsquo; Jack’s friend told him.</p>
<p>A hundred thoughts raced through my mind. What was he talking about? What was going on?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look, the only reason why I invited you here is to make you left out because you informed the teacher that I wasn’t paying attention,&rsquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>I was sinking into a sea of grief. Suddenly, I heard the voice of my mum calling me. It was music to our ears! I dashed out and sat next to my mum, narrating everything.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know why I picked you up extra early?&rsquo; my mum asked me.</p>
<p>I shake my head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because we are going to your friend’s place to play!&rsquo; my mum said with a smile.</p>
<p>My face lit up in contentment! I had a whale of a time at my friend’s place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quit building castles in the air and continue cleaning!&rsquo; my mum’s loud, booming voice snapped me back to reality.</p>
<p>I put the photograph back on the shelf and a small smile appeared on my face.</p>
