<p>I’m a programmer by trade and write codes for a living. Then 1 month ago, I decided to become a writer. Here are the reasons why I did it and how I do it.</p>
<h1 id="im-pursuing-my-hobby">I’m pursuing my hobby</h1>
<p>I never considered writing a hobby. I barely managed to pass my literature and English classes. I preferred subjects that did not require writing such as Mathematics, Chemistry, or Physics.</p>
<p>That started to change when I entered the workforce as a programmer. Young and curious, I embarked on multiple initiatives to improve an internal coding framework. As it was used by other people on the team, I needed a way to share information and instruction about the new changes I helped develop. I wrote new documentation, updated existing ones, and was often on the lookout for a better way to deliver them to my teammates. Word documents and emails were the first tools I used to communicate with the larger team. Then came Wiki software, first as a standalone installation, then as part of my company’s SharePoint.</p>
<p>I have been carrying that practice to every other company I worked for. The difference now is that I actively practice it and share my work with a wider audience.</p>

<p>I am good with languages, well, programming languages such as C, C#, Java, Javascript, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, SQL, etc&hellip; I had over 14 years of experience developing software, leading teams, and building products. I can definitely write about them.</p>

<p>Programming requires a great deal of logical thinking and structural design. The same applies to writing, especially with the type of content I want to focus on (above).</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/five-minimum-viable-javascript-interview-questions-d839d855a8a4">Five Minimum Viable Javascript Interview Questions</a> article, I stated what problem I tried to address and if it related to my readers, they should read on. For each following question, I again explained the reason I picked it and how relevant it is to them. A sample answer is then provided for the readers’ convenience (if they are interviewers) or for their learning (if they are interviewees).</p>

<p>If you are a developer, you must have heard of the word “agile”. Even if you are not, you probably have heard of it because it is a very trendy word at the moment.</p>

<p>There is a popular Agile methodology called <a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum</a>. Within Scrum, there is a concept called Sprint which is a period of time that normally lasts 1 or 2 weeks long. Developers develop new product features during a Sprint, review their work at the end of Sprint, conclude the Sprint, and then start a new Sprint in the immediately following week.</p>
<p>That’s my “agile” plan. My Sprint will be 1 week long. I will work on a few drafts each week, and try to release at least 1 article per week. And repeat these activities the week after. The goal is to build cadence, sustain the effort and incrementally build up my portfolio.</p>
