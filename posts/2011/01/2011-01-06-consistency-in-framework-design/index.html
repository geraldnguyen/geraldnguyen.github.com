<blockquote>
<p>Framework: a set of ideas, principles, agreements, or rules that provides the basis or outline for something intended to be more fully developed at a later stage (MSN Dictionary)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure if you agree, but for me, the above definition implies &ldquo;consistency&rdquo; as a essential effect of using a framework. In the context of software development, using a framework usually equals to following its design guideline, or  implementing/extending its interfaces/base classes. Things can stuck or go wrong and time will definitely be wasted if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I have only used 4 different application framework (.NET framework not included since it is comparably as big as Java standard API). 2 of them, Struts 2 and Spring MVC do not force me to explicitly implement their own interfaces, but implicitly I still have to. Such is due to expectation such as &ldquo;execute&rdquo; method returning a String in Struts 2 Action class or a controller method returning a ModelAndView in Spring MVC Controller classes. Futhermore, the fact that these semantically identical classes carrying different names in different frameworks (Action, Controller) clearly proves the influence of framework&rsquo;s design on the implementation details. The other 2 frameworks, both in-house, explicitly requires extending framework&rsquo;s base classes.</p>
<h1 id="building-an-inhouse-framework">Building an inhouse framework</h1>
<p>So, for me, consistency is expected if I use a framework. It is even more desirable if I build one.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t come as plentiful as I have hoped.</p>
<p>My current project is to build an in-house application framework. I am the team lead. There is no explicit project manager, so I assume I am (but did it poorly). At the beginning, there are little to develop and review, so the structure, design and implementation are pretty consistent. But when I started delegating design and implementing tasks to my team members, the level of consistency just kept getting lower. It&rsquo;s still manageable, I think. But I wish if I could keep it consistent throughout, I would have saved myself lots of time trying to persuade other members to refactor their design.</p>
<p>So, the lessons for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate the goal, design and implementation standard to all team members. Make sure they agree and abide by them. In my situation, I didn&rsquo;t even have a design and implementation standard. So&hellip;</li>
<li>Establish a design and implementation standard that all team members accept.</li>
<li>Review the design and implementation  and compare them with the agreed design and implementation standard. Make this a regular and seemingly serious activity. In my situation, I didn&rsquo;t review all of them; and didn&rsquo;t do it regularly. And I didn&rsquo;t make it seem serious enough.</li>
<li>Do not be afraid to discuss the design and implementation with your member. And willing to defend your idea (but be open to their reasonable arguments). In my situation, I sometimes afraid to discuss because my arguments are weak when there is no standard to back me up (and I&rsquo;m afraid of being seen micro-managing) .</li>
<li>Set example for the rest to follow. It&rsquo;s a human nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the above lessons, the most urgent and also very important one is to establish a standard. That&rsquo;s what I will do next. Better late than never.</p>
